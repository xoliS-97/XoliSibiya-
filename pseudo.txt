Scenario 1

1. Initialise variables 
 -Largest= Negative infinity(A very small number)
 -current number =0
 2. Loop until current number is 0
 - User must engter a positive number 
 - Read the current number
 - If the current number is> 0
 - meaning if current number > Largest
 update Largest= current number
 3. invalid input, enter a positive number or 0 to exit loop
 
 
 Scenario 2
 
 1. input (prompt user to enter first name)
 2. Users input in the Variable FirstName
 3. Print "Hello + first name + World
 
 
 Scenario 3
 
 1. ]Initialise Variables 
    - Sum=0 (To store the sum of intergers)
	- Count= 0 (To store the number of intergers)
2.  Input integer
    - if user wants to stop then Break
    - end if sum= sum+integer
	-count= count+1
3.  Calculate average 
    -average=sum/ count
4. Print average " No numbers entered"


Scenarion 4

1. Input Grocery list
 -left to buy
 -For each products in grocery list
 - if status = not bought then
 - Add product left to buy
 
 Scenario 5
 
	
 1. Input Read X and Y
 2. Calculate S= X+Y (Sum)
 3. A=S/2 i(Average)
 4. P= X x Y (product0
 5. S,A and P (output)
